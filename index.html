  <p>We're planning a School Walkout&mdash;into the hallway that is. We (7th graders during 7th grade lunch) will simply walk into the hallway. We <em>will not</em>:
  <ul>
    <li>Chant</li>
    <li>Cause any sort of disruption</li>
    <li>Meaningfully inconvience any staff or students</li>
    <li>Hold up signs</li>
    <li>Break any sort of rules</li>
    <li>Be rude</li>
    <li>Be eating</li>
    <li>or say much regarding the issues at all. (No "Mr. John Doe, we're here because we want the Mask Mandates to be re-instated").</li>
  <ul>
  We <em>will</em>:
  <ul>
    <li>Wear masks</li>
    <li>Stand in a meaningful spot of the hallway (preferably all near eachother or in a way that's clear we're associated)</li>
    <li>Attempt to walk in somewhat together or otherwise in a distinguishable or noticable way (but not one that is disruptive)</li>
    <li>Sign the signout sheet and</li>
    <li>Follow all school rules.</li>
  <ul>
  To be absolutely clear: The best and intended outcome for these first few times is that we walk into the hallway somewhat in sync, stand in one place, everyone is masked, and we get some teachers and students to think "Why are all these people so syncronized and clearly doing something?" Nothing more or less.<br>
  For Wave One, we <em>are protesting</em>:
  <ul>
    <li>The mask mandate being lifted for MCPS schools and</li>
    <li>The concerning state of most bathrooms and water fountains.</li>
  <ul>
  The first walkout is on March 11th, a Friday, and the second one is on March 14th, a Monday. Stay safe, and see you there.
